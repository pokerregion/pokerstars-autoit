# pokerstars-autoit

[Autoit library](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) for manipulating PokerStars.

It probably doesn't work anymore but has cool features like floating the Lobby out of the screen. When you hover the mouse over the edge of it, it floats in. It allowed me to play 12 tables with one monitor and the lobby did not took additional space.

It has functions to click buttons, close windows, open Cashier, hide the Cashier (not necessary anymore with PokerStars 7), save tournament filters or Apply a certain Layout.

License is MIT, do whatever you want with it.
